### <a name="description"> Description </a>

Multiword expressions (MWEs) are word combinations that exhibit lexical, syntactic, semantic, pragmatic, and/or statistical idiosyncrasies (Baldwin and Kim, 2010), such as by and large, hot dog, pay a visit and pull someone's leg. The notion encompasses closely related phenomena: idioms, compounds, light-verb constructions, phrasal verbs, rhetorical figures, collocations, institutionalized phrases, etc. Their behavior is often unpredictable; for example, their meaning often does not result from the direct combination of the meanings of their parts. Given their irregular nature, MWEs often pose complex problems in linguistic modeling (e.g. annotation), NLP tasks (e.g. parsing), and end-user applications (e.g. natural language understanding and MT), hence still representing an open issue for computational linguistics (Constant et al., 2017).

Universal Dependencies (UD; De Marneffe et al., 2021) is a framework for cross-linguistically consistent treebank annotation that has so far been applied to over 100 languages. The framework aims to capture similarities as well as idiosyncrasies among typologically different languages (e.g., morphologically rich languages, pro-drop languages, and languages featuring clitic doubling). The goal in developing UD was not only to support comparative evaluation and cross-lingual learning but also to facilitate multilingual natural language processing and enable comparative linguistic studies.

After independently running a successful series of workshops, the MWE and UD communities are now joining forces to organize a joint workshop. This is a timely collaboration because the two communities clearly have overlapping interests. For instance, while UD has several dependency relations that can be used to annotate MWEs, both annotation guidelines (i.e. is syntactic irregularity and inflexibility or semantic non-compositionality the leading criterion?) and annotation practice (both across treebanks for a single language and across languages) for these relations can be improved (Schneider and Zeldes, 2021). The PARSEME MWE-annotated corpora for 26 languages build on UD annotated corpora (Savary et al., 2023). Both communities share an interest in developing guidelines, data-sets, and tools that can be applied to a wide range of typologically diverse languages, raising fundamental questions about tokenization, lemmatization, and morphological decomposition of tokens. Proposals for harmonizing annotation practice between what has been achieved in PARSEME and UD and expanding PARSEME MWE annotation to non-verbal MWEs are also central to the recently started UniDive COST action (CA21167). 

The workshop invites submissions of original research on MWE, UD, and the interplay of both. In particular, the following topics are especially relevant: 
- Sensitivity of LLMs to MWE and syntactic dependencies. Studies along the lines of Manning et al. (2020) (UD), Nedumpozhimana and Kelleher (2021), Garcia et al. (2021), Fakharian and Cook (2021), Moreau et al. (2018) (MWE), and others on the question to what extent LLMs make use of syntactic dependencies or are capable of detecting MWEs and capturing their semantics. 
- Applicability of UD and MWE annotation and discovery for low-resource and typologically diverse languages and language varieties. Both UD and PARSEME aim at universal applicability across a wide range of languages. Much theoretical, computational, and empirical work concentrates on high-resource languages however. Applying these frameworks to typologically diverse languages may lead one to reconsider the notion of token, word, and morphological segmentation, and to reassess the notion of MWE for languages that feature compounding or incorporation (Baldwin et al., 2021; Haspelmath, 2023).
- Case studies.  Studies on the  consistency,  coverage or universal applicability of MWE annotation in the UD or PARSEME frameworks, as well as studies on automatic detection and interpretation of MWEs in corpora.
- MWE and UD processing to enhance end-user applications. MWEs have gained particular attention in end-user applications, including MT (Zaninello and Birch, 2020; Han et al., 2021), simplification (Kochmar et al., 2020), language learning and assessment (Paquot et al., 2019; Christiansen and Arnon, 2017), social media mining (Maisto et al., 2017), and abusive language detection (Zampieri et al., 2020; Caselli et al., 2020). We believe that it is crucial to extend and deepen these first attempts to integrate and evaluate MWE technology in these and further end-user applications.
- Testing developed systems on the latest dataset versions. Authors are also encouraged to submit papers that test the developed systems using the recent UD 2.13 and/or PARSEME 1.3 releases.

### <a name="submission">Submission Formats</a>

The workshop invites  two types of submissions: 
- Archival submissions that present substantially original research in both long paper format (8 pages + references) and short paper format (4 pages + references)
- Non-archival submissions of abstracts describing relevant research presented/published elsewhere which will not be included in the MWE-UD proceedings.

-----

### <a name="instructions">Paper Submission and Templates</a>

Papers should be submitted via the workshop’s [START submission page](https://softconf.com/lrec-coling2024/mwe-ud2024/). Please choose the appropriate submission format (archival/non-archival). Submissions must follow the [LREC-COLING 2024 stylesheet](https://lrec-coling-2024.org/authors-kit/).

When submitting a paper from the START page, authors will be asked to provide essential information about resources (in a broad sense, i.e. also technologies, standards, evaluation kits, etc.) that have been used for the research described in the paper or are a new result of the research. Moreover, ELRA encourages all LREC-COLING authors to share the described LRs (data, tools, services, etc.) to enable their reuse and replicability of experiments (including evaluation ones)

Archival papers with existing reviews from ACL Rolling Review (ARR)) will also be considered. A paper may not be under review through ARR and MWE-UD simultaneously. A paper that has or will receive reviews through ARR may not be submitted for review to MWE-UD.

### <a name="award">Best Paper Award and Travel Grants</a>

- Best paper award criteria TBD
- UniDive members with accepted papers may be eligible for travel reimbursement via UniDive.
- Accepted authors from underrepresented groups (e.g., an underrepresented counry) or accepted authors of work on low-resource languages may be eligible to apply for an ACL-SIGLEX travel grant of upto 500 USD.
